Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
Deploy the project directly from GitHub.
Netlify will automatically handle the build process and deployment. For more details, refer to the Netlify Deployment Guide.

Technologies
This project uses the following technologies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI (MUI): A popular React component library for Material Design components.
Styled Components: For writing CSS-in-JS, allowing scoped and customizable styles.
Lazy Loading: To load components like the YouTube embed only when needed, improving performance.
Suspense: For handling asynchronous component loading with a fallback UI (e.g., loading spinner).
Styling Strategy
The project uses Styled Components for styling, which allows writing CSS inside JavaScript files. This makes it easier to manage and reuse styles across the project, improving component modularity.

Additionally, Material-UI (MUI) components are used for pre-designed, clean, and consistent design. For certain sections, custom styles are applied using MUI’s styled API to adjust themes, spacing, and typography.

Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using the MUI grid system and custom breakpoints. The sx prop in MUI components adjusts layouts based on screen sizes.

Example:

tsx
Copy code
<Stack direction={{ xs: 'column', md: 'row' }} alignItems="center">
  <Box flex={1}>
    <StyledTitle variant="h1">Most important title on the page</StyledTitle>
  </Box>
</Stack>
SEO Strategy
Basic SEO practices are applied, including:

Proper usage of HTML tags like <h1>, <h2>, etc., for titles and headings.
Metadata can be extended using React Helmet for each page (e.g., title, description, etc.).
Lazy loading ensures that only the required assets are loaded, improving page speed, which is crucial for SEO rankings.
Performance Considerations
Lazy Loading: React’s lazy() is used for components like the YouTube embed, ensuring resources are only loaded when needed.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
const YouTubeEmbed = lazy(() => import('../YouTubeEmbed/YouTubeEmbed'));
Suspense Fallback: While waiting for lazy-loaded components, a loading spinner or message is shown.
Example:

tsx
Copy code
<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <YouTubeEmbed videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ" autoplay={false} showControls />
</Suspense>
Minimal Re-renders: Use React.memo and optimize unnecessary renders by passing proper props to components.
Assumptions
This project assumes:

You are using the latest versions of React and Material-UI.
The target browsers are modern ones, like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
For SEO optimization, tools like react-helmet can be integrated in the future for better metadata management.
